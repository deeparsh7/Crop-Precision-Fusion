# Crop-Precision-Fusion


The Crop Precision Fusion System using Random Forest Classifier is a machine learning project implemented in Python . The system aims to provide accurate crop recommendations to farmers based on various parameters. It utilizes the Random Forest Classifier algorithm to 
analyze the dataset and predict suitable crops for given soil and environmental conditions The system utilizes a dataset containing parameters such as N (ratio of Nitrogen content in soil), P (ratio of Phosphorous content in soil), K (ratio of Potassium content in soil), 
temperature (in degree Celsius), humidity (relative humidity in %), pH (ph value of the soil), and rainfall (in mm). These parameters play a crucial role in determining the suitable crops for cultivation.
By leveraging the power of machine learning and the convenience of a web-based interface, the Crop Recommendation System aims to assist farmers in making informed decisions about crop selection, ultimately maximizing their agricultural productivity and yield
